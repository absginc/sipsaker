# sipsaker
#### Docker Application w/ sipsak command-line tool powered by a node/express application 


This is a Docker application for running the sipsak network tool.  It includes the sipsak command-line tool and a Node.js app that provides a REST API for accessing Sipsak functionality.  SIP OPTION messages are executed by an HTTP POST request that provides the results of the SIP OPTIONS request by HTTP status for easy use in uptime kuma or other monitoring tools.

Use the source in app.js and build a route in your existing node express application or deploy this simple docker container to run as a sipsaker.

### Monitor your VOIP server with Uptime Kuma or other monitoring tools.

## Installation
To run this application, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine.

### Build Image
Run the following command from the repository folder to build the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t sipsaker .
```
The command will build the Docker image with the name "sipsaker". 


### Deploy Container
Once the image is built, you can run a Docker container based on the image using the following command:
```console
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d -â€”name sipsaker-container sipsaker
```

This command will start a new Docker container based on the "sipsaker" image, map port 3000 inside the container to port 3000 on the host, and name the container "sipsaker-container". 


## Usage
The Sipsaker Docker application provides an API for accessing Sipsak functionality

 To use the API, send an HTTP POST requests to the /sipsak endpoint:
* The SIP host IP is sent in the value of key name "hostIp"
* Optionally "hostPort" can be provided if it differs from 5060.
* Successful SIP OPTION will return (200 OK) and "SIP server is AVAILABLE"
* UN-Successful SIP OPTION with no option reply will return (502 Bad Gateway) and "SIP server is NOT available"

### CURL EXAMPLE
```console
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hostIp":"194.201.25.19"}' http://localhost:3000/sipsak
```
```console
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hostIp":"194.201.25.19","hostPort":"5080"}' http://localhost:3000/sipsak
```

### UPTIME KUMA Integration Example
* Create a new Monitor with a Monitor Type of HTTP(s)
* Use the URL of your sipsaker application,  POST to the /sipsak resource
* Change the HTTP Options method to POST
* Assemble JSON containing at minimum a value for hostIp, and optionally a value for hostPort if it differs from 5060.

200 OK is the response for a good ping.  502 is returned for a bad ping.
