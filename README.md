# Sipsaker
#### Docker Application w/ sipsak command-line tool powered by a node/express application providing SIP OPTION results executed by HTTP POST results for use in uptime kuma or other monitoring tools.

This is a Docker application for running the Sipsak network tool.  It includes the Sipsak command-line tool and a Node.js app that provides a REST API for accessing Sipsak functionality. 

Use the source in app.js to build a route in your existing node express application or deploy a simple docker container to run as a sipsaker.

### Monitor your VOIP server with Uptime Kuma or other monitoring tools.

## Installation
To run this application, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine.

### Build Image
Run the following command from the repository folder to build the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t sipsaker .
```
The command will build the Docker image with the name "sipsaker". 


### Deploy Container
Once the image is built, you can run a Docker container based on the image using the following command:
```console
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d â€”name sipsaker-container sipsaker
```

This command will start a new Docker container based on the "sipsaker" image, map port 3000 inside the container to port 3000 on the host, and name the container "sipsaker-container". 


## Usage
The Sipsaker Docker application provides an API for accessing Sipsak functionality

 To use the API, send an HTTP POST requests to the following endpoint:
* /sipsak: with a host IP value to "hostIp" and optionally a value of "hostPort" if it differs from 5060.
* Successful SIP OPTION will return a 200 OK response and SIP server is AVAILABLE
* UN-Successful SIP OPTION with no reply will return a 502 response and SIP server is NOT available

### CURL EXAMPLE
```console
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hostIp":"194.201.25.19"}' http://localhost:3000/sipsak
```
```console
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hostIp":"194.201.25.19","hostPort":"5080"}' http://localhost:3000/sipsak
```

### UPTIME KUMA Integration Example
* Create a new Monitor with a Monitor Type of HTTP(s)
* Use the URL of your sipsaker application posting to the /sipsak resource
* Change the HTTP Options method to POST
* Assemble some JSON containing at minimum a value for hostIp, and optionally a value for hostPort if it differs from 5060.

200 OK is the response for a good ping.  502 is returned for a bad ping.
